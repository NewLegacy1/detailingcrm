      <ul>
        <li><strong>Free Trial:</strong> New accounts receive a 14-day free trial with full access to all features. No credit card is required to start a trial. After the trial period, continued use requires a paid subscription.</li>
        <li><strong>Billing:</strong> Subscriptions are billed monthly or annually in advance. All prices are in Canadian dollars (CAD) unless otherwise stated. Applicable taxes (HST/GST) will be added at checkout.</li>

        <li><strong>Price changes:</strong> We reserve the right to change subscription pricing. We will provide at least 30 days' notice of any price increase via email. Your continued use after the notice period constitutes acceptance of the new pricing.</li>
        <li><strong>Founding member pricing:</strong> If you subscribed at a promotional "founding member" rate, that rate is locked in for the life of your subscription as long as it remains active without a break in service.</li>

        <li>DetailOps subscription fees are charged separately and are not related to client payment flows</li>

    <section id="disclaimer">
      <h2><a href="#disclaimer">Section 08 — Platform Disclaimer</a></h2>

    </section>

    <section id="termination">
      <h2><a href="#termination">Section 11 — Termination</a></h2>

      <p>Before initiating formal legal proceedings, you agree to contact us at legal@detailops.com and attempt to resolve the dispute informally for at least 30 days.</p>
      <p>Any disputes that cannot be resolved informally shall be submitted to binding arbitration in Toronto, Ontario, under the Arbitration Act of Ontario. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding.</p>
      <p>Notwithstanding the above, either party may seek injunctive or other equitable relief from a court of competent jurisdiction in Ontario.</p>
